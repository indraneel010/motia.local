# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Install and configure Turborepo foundation


  - Add turbo as a dev dependency to root package.json
  - Create initial turbo.json configuration file with basic pipeline
  - Update root package.json scripts to use turbo commands
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_



- [ ] 2. Configure build task pipeline with caching
  - Define build task dependencies in turbo.json pipeline
  - Configure build outputs and cache settings for TypeScript compilation


  - Set up proper dependency chain (^build) for packages that depend on others
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Configure test task pipeline with intelligent caching

  - Define test task configuration in turbo.json with build dependencies
  - Configure test caching based on source and test file changes
  - Set up test task to depend on build completion
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 3.3_



- [ ] 4. Configure lint task pipeline for parallel execution
  - Define lint task in turbo.json pipeline for parallel execution
  - Configure lint caching based on source file changes
  - Ensure lint tasks can run independently without build dependencies


  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Update development workflow scripts
  - Configure dev tasks in turbo.json as persistent tasks without caching


  - Update dev scripts to use turbo for dependency management
  - Ensure watch mode and hot reloading continue working unchanged
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_


- [ ] 6. Implement cache optimization and monitoring
  - Configure cache output patterns for all build artifacts
  - Add cache debugging scripts and logging configuration
  - Implement cache size monitoring and cleanup strategies
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.4_


- [ ] 7. Add performance testing and validation
  - Create scripts to measure build performance before and after turbo
  - Implement automated tests to verify build output compatibility
  - Add validation that all existing npm scripts continue working


  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Configure remote cache setup (optional)
  - Add remote cache configuration options to turbo.json
  - Create documentation for team cache sharing setup
  - Implement cache security and access control guidelines
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 9. Update CI/CD integration
  - Modify CI/CD scripts to use turbo commands
  - Configure cache population and sharing in CI environment
  - Add cache warming strategies for optimal performance
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Create migration documentation and tooling
  - Write migration guide for developers switching to turbo workflow
  - Create troubleshooting documentation for common issues
  - Add performance monitoring and debugging tools
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.4_
