# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Turborepo build caching and task orchestration to significantly improve build performance in the Motia monorepo. The optimization will reduce build times through intelligent caching, parallel execution, and dependency-aware task scheduling while maintaining all existing functionality and security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster build times so that I can iterate more quickly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pnpm build` THEN the system SHALL cache build outputs and reuse them when inputs haven't changed
2. WHEN I run builds repeatedly with no changes THEN the system SHALL complete in under 5 seconds using cached results
3. WHEN I change a single package THEN the system SHALL only rebuild that package and its dependents
4. WHEN multiple packages can build in parallel THEN the system SHALL execute them concurrently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent task orchestration so that builds are optimized automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run any build command THEN the system SHALL automatically determine the optimal execution order based on dependencies
2. WHEN a package has no dependents THEN the system SHALL build it in parallel with other independent packages
3. WHEN a build fails THEN the system SHALL stop dependent builds but continue with independent ones
4. WHEN I run tests THEN the system SHALL only test packages whose code or dependencies have changed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality so that no workflows are broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use existing npm scripts THEN they SHALL continue to work exactly as before
2. WHEN I run development commands THEN watch mode and hot reloading SHALL work unchanged
3. WHEN I run linting or testing THEN all existing checks SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN I build for production THEN all output artifacts SHALL be identical to current builds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared build caching so that team members benefit from each other's builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team members work on the same codebase THEN they SHALL be able to share build cache when possible
2. WHEN CI/CD runs builds THEN it SHALL populate cache for local development use
3. WHEN cache is shared THEN it SHALL maintain security and not expose sensitive information
4. WHEN cache becomes stale or corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to fresh builds gracefully
